# Predictive-Model-for-Service-Calls-Payment

In this project, we are provided information on clients that have a bill due in the next 5 days and regardless of whether they have called in a service payment. Our aim is to build a predictive model that detects clients who will probably make a service payment call (CALL_FLAG=1) within the next 5 days. This approach will be used to choose clients who can expect a preemptive e-mail urging individuals to make payments online.
